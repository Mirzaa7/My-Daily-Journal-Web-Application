# My-Daily-Journal-Web-Application
This web application is a daily journal created using Node.js and Express.js. It is a simple journal where new posts are created dynamically and rendered on the required pages along with the current date of the post.

To run the application, you need to install the required node modules to the project directory, which are specified in the package.JSON file, simply by directing to the project folder and typing "npm install" in the command line.
